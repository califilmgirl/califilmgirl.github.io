              I don't sit in while you're running it down. I drive. It's nice to be around people that have a sense of the world around them, that are, in general, more conscious and conscientious. You get a new one. If ever I try to predict, I'm sure I will be instantly humbled.

              The pictures which will be accompanying this interview are basically of me in tight wet T-shirts and tiny leather jackets going around in the rain and pretending that I'm a lot cooler than I am. I get sick of myself, so I can imagine how everyone else feels. You tell me where we start, where we're going, where we're going afterwards. I was very excited. I could be fun, if you want.

              You just have to hang out in places that are more interesting than you are. I think the one thing I love most about being an adult is the right to buy candy whenever and wherever I want. I won't eat my cereal. I think like a girl, I think. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'.
