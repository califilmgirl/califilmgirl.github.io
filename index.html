        "I love being Canadian. I think growing up in Canada gives you a world perspective that I certainly enjoy. I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me. Change moves in spirals, not circles. I wrote you everyday for a year. Then, telling Derek Cianfrance that I'd ever I could rob a bank I'd do it on my motorcycle, and he said 'That's weird, I just wrote a script about that'."
        <br>
        "And its important to know that there are some changes you can't control and that there are others you can. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'. The pictures which will be accompanying this interview are basically of me in tight wet T-shirts and tiny leather jackets going around in the rain and pretending that I'm a lot cooler than I am. I don't know enough about manliness to define it. When you breathe, you inhale and you exhale, but every single time that you do that you're a little bit different then the one before."
        <br>
        "I'm not a good enough actor to become a character. Anything a minute on either side of that and you're on your own. It's nice to be around people that have a sense of the world around them, that are, in general, more conscious and conscientious. I'm going to get to ride the bike up, rob it, and ride the bank away. I get sick of myself, so I can imagine how everyone else feels."
